  * 例如 物体的状态：液态的、固态的
  * 固有的状态
* status
  * 一般可枚举，指有那些状态
  * 可指在固定状态中流转
  * 例如 任务状态：停止、运行、初始化
  * 具体情况，例如 status of stop state - 描述停止的原因

## Concurrency vs Parallelism / 并发 vs 并行

* 并发
  * 例如 1核心的CPU运行4个线程
* 并行
  * 例如 4核心的CPU运行4个线程

摘自 Akka 文档

Concurrency and parallelism are related concepts, but there are small differences.
Concurrency means that two or more tasks are making progress even though they might not be executing simultaneously. 
This can for example be realized with time slicing where parts of tasks are executed sequentially and mixed with parts of other tasks.
Parallelism on the other hand arise when the execution can be truly simultaneous.

## Deadlock vs Starvation vs Live-lock / 死锁 vs 饥饿 vs 活锁

* 死锁
  * A B 两个线程， R1 R2 两个资源，A持有R1需要R2，B持有R2需要R1
* 饥饿 
  * A B 两个线程， R1 R2 两个资源，A持有R1和R2需要R2，B需要R1才能继续进行
* 活锁
  * A B 两个线程， R1 R2 两个资源，A持有R1每隔一段时间检测R2是否可用，B持有R2每隔一段时间检测R1是否可用
  * 都在允许，但无法进行到下一步

摘自 Akka 文档

Deadlock arises when several participants are waiting on each other to reach a specific state to be able to progress.
As none of them can progress without some other participant to reach a certain state (a “Catch-22” problem) all
affected subsystems stall. Deadlock is closely related to blocking, as it is necessary that a participant thread be
able to delay the progression of other threads indefinitely.
In the case of deadlock, no participants can make progress, while in contrast Starvation happens, when there are
participants that can make progress, but there might be one or more that cannot. Typical scenario is the case
of a naive scheduling algorithm that always selects high-priority tasks over low-priority ones. If the number of
incoming high-priority tasks is constantly high enough, no low-priority ones will be ever finished.
Livelock is similar to deadlock as none of the participants make progress. The difference though is that instead
of being frozen in a state of waiting for others to progress, the participants continuously change their state. An
example scenario when two participants have two identical resources available. They each try to get the resource,
but they also check if the other needs the resource, too. If the resource is requested by the other participant, they
try to get the other instance of the resource. In the unfortunate case it might happen that the two participants
“bounce” between the two resources, never acquiring it, but always yielding to the other.
